TODO:
BPM tempo-based sequencer (instead of ms)
Basic chord sequencer.
Basic rhythm (drum, or bass?) sequencer
Time-delta scheduler (so we can do rhythms like [3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2],
Introduce idea of sections to sequencer, for different chord progressions?
Time patterns / triggers? (no longer sure how this differs from above)

Euclidean Sequencer / Pattern

Defer working on the custom syntax until the core system can product a whole song. Maybe that should be a separate project.
