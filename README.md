TODO:
- Introduce idea of sections to Song, for different chord progressions?
- Automatic voice leading, esp for chord progressions, maybe for bass/lead too (prefer intervals less than a tritone)?

Euclidean Sequencer / Pattern

Defer working on the custom syntax until the core system can product a whole song. Maybe that should be a separate project.
